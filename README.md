🔹 Task - 4: Combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build fully functioning projects

I'm excited to share my latest web development project where I successfully completed three hands-on modules focusing on front-end skills and interactive design!

🔧 Here’s what I built:

⿡ Personal Portfolio Website
📌 A responsive, multi-page portfolio showcasing my skills and projects with sections like About, Projects, and Contact.

⿢ To-Do List / Note-Taking App
📝 Developed an app with localStorage to save tasks or notes even after page reloads. Perfect for task management!

⿣ Product Listing Page with Filter and Sort Options
🛒 Created a dynamic product page allowing users to filter items by category or price, and sort them by rating.

These projects helped me strengthen my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and local data handling. Looking forward to building more interactive and user-friendly web applications!
